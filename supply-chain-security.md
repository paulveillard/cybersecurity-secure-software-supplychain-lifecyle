# Supply Chain Security: How to Protect Containerized Applications

Managing today’s software — composed of a combination of open source code, in-house code, and third-party code — has elevated the application risk from design and build through production and management. With more points of vulnerability within today’s software supply chain, the number of attacks has grown exponentially.

> It’s not enough anymore to simply run security tests at the end of the development and production process. Waiting that long can have a huge negative impact on your business. In the cloud native era, security needs to be a focal point throughout production and the entire application life cycle.

In the cloud native era, properly securing the **software supply chain starts at the very beginning of the development process and continues throughout production and the entire application life cycle. The tradition of implementing security tests at the end of the development and production process or patching running applications is outmoded.**

> Improper security implementation can seriously impact business by delaying important releases in order to address issues found later in the software life cycle or by losing security fixes that were only applied to running workloads.


Just as automation is key for Kubernetes, it’s also critical for the software supply chain. Proper security is continuous, with security gates implemented throughout the build, deploy and runtime process. Proper security allows developers to do their work with guidance from security policies implemented with automated tools that analyze, monitor and intervene when things go awry.
