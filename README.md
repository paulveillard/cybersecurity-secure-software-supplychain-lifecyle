## Introduction

#### Why software security and secure supply chains matter even more today:

Digital Transformation continues at a relentless pace, putting even greater responsiblity on business executives to meet new demands of a fully customer experience. With every organization now a software-driven company, technology leaders are expected to enable business outcomes like flexibility and scale from moving to the cloud.
However, many struggle to maintain consisten security and performance in their complex, hybrid IT environment, stalling transformation efforts in their software factory.

**Organizations need integrated security tooling and processes that support DevSecOps Practices, driven in part by the following**
```
- Elevated complexity for secure development
- The growing use of open source components
- New attack vectors discovered each day
- Stricter regulatory requirements
```

## Software Supply Chain DevSecOps Challenge
- Maintaining and Improving legacy applications and infrastructure is complicated and places strain on already limited IT Resources
- Building and running brand new applications using modern frameworks and cloud-native application architectures increases cognitive load for dev teams
- Security is often an afterthought that's handled by security and IT operations teams at the end of the application development life cycle, with little to no collaboration with app development and other teams

DevSecOps Best Practices for Developers:

Implement Security Early and Often
Automate Security Wherever Possible
